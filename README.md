# Qubership Integration Variables Management Service

Variables Management Service is a part of Qubership Integration Platform.
It provides an API for operations on variables within the integration platform.
These variables are designed to store parts of solution configuration that is needed to be provided to the integration logic.

Service defines two kinds of variables: common and secured.

Common variables are stored in Consul and should not be used to store any sensitive data.

Secured variables are designed to store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, etc. and stored in a cloud as secrets.
An arbitrary number of secrets can be used to store secured variables.
By default ```qip-secured-variables-v2``` secret is used.
Label ```qip-variable-type``` is added to secrets that store Integration Platform variables.

All operations on variables are being logged, and an API is provided to get the action journal.

## Installation

Variables Management Service is a Spring Boot Application and requires Java 21 and Maven to build.
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided to build a containerized application.
It can be run locally using a [docker compose configuration](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-platform).

## Configuration

Application parameters can be set by environment variables.

Configuration can be overridden with values stored in Consul.
The ```config/${NAMESPACE}``` prefix is used.

Application has 'development' Spring profile to run service locally with minimum dependencies.
